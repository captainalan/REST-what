According to Wikipedia, **Representational state transfer** (REST) is 

> ...a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to 
> be used for creating Web services.

In turn, the **architecture** of a software system

> ...is a metaphor, analogous to the architecture of a building.

## Routes and Endpoints

**Routes**, as you are likely to encounter them working with JavaScript, are
**URIs** mapped to different HTTP methods.

## Requests and Responses

In Express, **requests** and **responses** are seen as parameters of 
callback functions.

## Making some sentences

A *RESTful* API may allow *CRUD* operations on via *HTTP* methods.
