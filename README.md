# RESTful APIs Demystified with Express

This tutorial is about **RESTful API**. In addition to discussing what exactly
Restful APIs are and how they are useful, we will also build one using
Node and Express.

## What is an API?

**Application Programming Interfaces** (APIs) are instructions, standards, and
tools designed for human beings to make programs talk to each other (which in
turn may talk to human beings).

## What is REST?

According to Wikipedia, **Representational state transfer** (REST) is 

> ...a software architectural style that defines a set of constraints to 
> be used for creating Web services.

In turn, the **architecture** of a software system

> ...is a metaphor, analogous to the architecture of a building.

A *RESTful* API is thus an API designed around a particular set of constraints.
We'll discuss more about what those constraints are below as we build a RESTful
API.

## Routes and Endpoints

**Routes**, as you are likely to encounter them working with JavaScript, are
**URIs** mapped to different HTTP methods.

## Requests and Responses

In Express, **requests** and **responses** are seen as parameters of 
callback functions.

Requests ask a server for some data.

Responses are the data you get back from the API.

## Making some sentences

A *RESTful* API may allow *CRUD* operations on via *HTTP* methods.
